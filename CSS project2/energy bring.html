    <h2>BRING – Biomass Residue Intelligence Global </h2>
    <p>The world generates over 5 billion tons of biomass residues annually, if one considers all types of biomass.
        Residues were considered as “waste” until sometime back, a costly assumption that the world is now trying to correct.
        The residues from the crops, plants, trees and shrubs whose main “fruit” is what we use, could be, in many cases, more valuable than the “fruit” itself.</p>
        <p>Biomass Residue Intelligence Global 
            is an ambitious effort by BioBiz to start aggregating intelligence for all the relevant biomass residues, with the aim of getting all  these utilized productively.</p>
